		<h3 class="InfoP">Climate Change</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">Climate change, one of the most important trends that scientists look at, is the increasing average temperature of the Earth, called global warming.  Global warming leads to other changes in the Earth’s climate, eg stronger hurricanes, melting glaciers, and the loss of wildlife habitats. When air temperatures rise, the oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere and become warmer. Warmer oceans, in turn, can cause stronger storms.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Greenhouse Gases</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">For more than 100 years, people have been burning large amounts of fossil fuel ― coal, oil, and natural gas ― to power their homes, factories, and vehicles. This releases carbon dioxide (CO2), a heat-trapping gas, into the atmosphere.  Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, which makes the Earth warmer.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Carbon Dioxide</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas. Burning fossil fuels releases the CO2 stored millions of years ago. CO2 is probably the most important of the greenhouse gases as it accounts for the largest proportion of the 'trace gases' and is currently responsible for 60 per cent of the 'enhanced greenhouse effect'.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Methane</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">The importance of methane in the greenhouse effect is its warming effect. Even though it occurs in lower concentrations than CO2, it produces 21 times as much warming as CO2. Methane accounts for 20 per cent of the 'enhanced greenhouse effect'.  Methane is generated naturally by bacteria that break down organic matter, it is found in the guts of termites and other animals and in natural gas deposits.  Methane remains in the atmosphere for 11–12 years — less time than most other greenhouse gases.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Computer's Negative impact on Climate Change</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">Computers, printers, mobile phones and the widgets that accompany them account for the emission of about two per cent of the estimated total of emissions from human activity. And that is the same as the aviation industry's contribution. 25 per cent of the emissions in question are generated by the manufacture of computers. The rest come from their use.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Manufacture</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">Producing computers uses up lots of energy. This adds to climate change because fossil fuels are burned to create the energy.  70 per cent of the energy a typical laptop will consume during its lifespan is used in manufacturing the computer: 227–270 kilograms (or 500–594 pounds) of CO2 are emitted in manufacturing a laptop computer.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), a binary compound of nitrogen and fluorine, is a colourless, toxic, non-flammable, corrosive gas shipped in cylinders at high pressure. NF3 is a greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential (GWP) 17,200 times greater than that of CO2 when compared over a 100-year period. NF3 is used as a chamber cleaning gas in the manufacture of semiconductors, flat panel displays and other electronic devices. When released into the atmosphere it has a powerful and long-lasting warming effect.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Use of Electricity</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">A typical desktop computer uses about 65–250 watts. Add another 15–70 watts for an LCD monitor. A typical cable modem uses 7 watts, a router: 4.5 watts.  Most laptop computers use about 15–60 watts, far less than desktops.</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Server Farms</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">By far the biggest use of energy by computers is made by the server farms that power the internet.  	‘Server farms’ is the term used to describe the vast arrays of servers used by large internet-based companies like Google and Amazon.  Server farms contain thousands of servers and use a lot of energy to power them and to cool them. One 50,000 square foot data centre uses about 5 megawatts, enough to power 5,000. This level of energy consumption is just by the servers themselves. The cooling systems use as much energy as the plants!</p>
		<h3 class="InfoP">Saving Energy</h3>
			<p class="InfoP">There are many ways in which computers can help cut down on our use of energy. Computers are steadily improving the amount of energy that they use with the smaller computers producing less CO2 than larger desktop computers.</p>
